    <h1>Claim</h1>
    <p>A structure I believe is in the mystery black box is a tube dividing the water which makes the water come out in different amounts.</p>
    <h1Evidence</h1>
    <p>The mystery black box is a box where you put the water on top and the water comes from the front but you canâ€™t see inside of it. Our initial observations were that every time you poured water into the funnel the amount of water was never the same. For example in trial 1, 500ml was poured in and only 110ml came out but for trial 2 500ml was poured in and 370ml came out. We did our own experiment to test how the mystery black box worked. We put a funnel on top of a box which led to a tube that came all the way down into the front of the box but in the middle of the tube there was another one attached to the tube which led the water to a water bottle. In trial 5 we poured 700ml and 650ml came out. In trial 8 700 ml was poured in but 750ml came out.</p>
